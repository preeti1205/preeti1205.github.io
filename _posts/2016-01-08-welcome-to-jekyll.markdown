I am Preeti Bhandari. I am second year Computer Engineering graduate student at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering. I'm a programming enthusiast and seek elegant solutions to problems to the point of annoyance. Lately, I have found myself being drawn to the world of competitive programming and so you will find a lot of mathematics on my bookshelf! No finishes at the podium so far but you know what they say - ** Keep Calm and Game on ! **
